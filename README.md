# Synapse Web Client (SWC)
The Synapse Web Client is a [Google Web Toolkit](http://www.gwtproject.org/)-based [single-page application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application), the web client of the Synapse REST service core.  It provides access to the the cloud-hosted [Synapse backend services](https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/Synapse-Repository-Services).
