				<h2>About Synapse</h2>
				<div class="info">
					The past two decades have seen an amazing exponential growth in the
					availability of genetic and other important biomolecular data
					fueled by incredible advances in measurement technologies. These
					breakthroughs have resulted in an increasing amount of money spent
					on research by industry and research papers written by academia.
					However, despite a few examples of new block-buster drugs, we have
					not witnessed a general rapid improvement in the treatment of many
					significant human diseases. Indeed, the numbers of new drugs
					approved by the FDA has actually declined over this same period. <br />
					<br /> A fundamental reason improvement in clinical outcomes does
					not match the pace of biological data production is that the
					analysis and interpretation of this data remain largely an
					individual activity limited by the bandwidth of an individual
					scientist. Drug development pipelines require a series of handoffs
					among many individual scientists, each with different areas of
					expertise. In our experience, the ability to access, understand,
					reformat, and reuse data, analysis methods, or models of disease at
					each step in the pipeline is a significant rate-limiting step, even
					within the confines of a single company or research institution.
					Additionally, much of the relevant data to answer a particular
					research question is spread among multiple public and private
					repositories. Because each pharmaceutical company and academic
					group protects their own data, the end result is enormous
					duplication of effort and missed opportunities across the industry
					as a whole. <br /> <br /> Sage Bionetworks&#146; mission is to
					catalyze a cultural transition from the traditional single lab,
					single-company, and single-therapy R&D paradigm to a model based on
					broad precompetitive collaboration on the analysis of large scale
					data in medical sciences. If this were to happen it would benefit
					future patients through improved treatments to diseases. It would
					benefit society through reduced costs of health care. It could even
					benefit the pharmaceutical industry, which is struggling to replace
					the revenue lost as old medicines go off patent production, by
					seeding increased innovation in the sector. Sage Bionetworks is
					actively engaged with academic, industrial, government, and
					philanthropic collaborators in developing solutions to these
					issues. <br /> <br /> The technology component of Sage&#146;s
					solution strategy is Synapse, an informatics platform for open
					data-driven science. Synapse will provide support for Sage
					Bionetwork&#146;s own research initiatives, but more importantly
					serve as a public resource for the broader scientific community. <br />
					<br /> Catalyzing a transformation to truly collaborative research
					requires that the platform help scientists solve a series of
					problems that impede truly collaborative work today: <br /> <br />
					<ol>
						<li><b>Finding and using relevant data</b> - Frequently today
							scientists have difficulty just tracking down and gaining access
							to resources created by others, even within the confines of the
							same organization. Even when data is available, ~75% of the work
							of an analysis project is spent understanding data structures and
							preprocessing data for analysis. Synapse provides ways to not
							only make data discoverable, but push data to leverage common
							formats, controlled vocabularies, and annotation standards that
							allow data to be described and exposed to analysis unambiguously.





						
						<li><b>Understanding analysis workflows</b> - Synapse
							accounts for the fact that much research is experimental and ad
							hoc in nature, and that hardened analysis methods only emerge
							over time. Tracking who has run what version of code on what
							version of the data in a project is the key to reproducible, and
							therefore improvable, research.
						<li><b>Supporting genome-scale analysis</b> - Analyzing
							datasets with information on whole genomes is currently limited
							to those with access to large computational resources and
							significant IT support. Synapse makes cloud computing
							technologies accessible to scientists.
						<li><b>Forming and maintaining productive collaborations</b>
							– Scientists tend to start from scratch on a project rather than
							take work in an unknown state. The platform must help scientists
							track what work has already been done in a particular area and
							help create and sustain collaborations.
					</ol>
					<br /> To support the vision described above, a variety of types
					of users will need to interact with Synapse for different purposes.
					Initially the Synapse system will be focused on supporting the
					statistical or computational biologist power users in manipulating
					clinical and genomics data sets; over time support could grow for
					more biological or clinically focused researchers. Synapse
					leverages a web service-based architecture in which a common set of
					services is accessed via different sets of client applications to
					support a growing set of use cases over time. <br /> <br /> One
					client application is the Synapse web portal. This is a “Web 2.0”
					environment for scientists to discover and share data, models, and
					analysis methods. The portal is organized around projects, which
					any scientist can create and invite collaborators to join. These
					online workspaces then serve as the glue to help teams of
					researchers collaborate to solve complex scientific analysis
					problems. Additional capabilities to visualize data and interact
					with disease models through the web portal will be developed over
					time. <br /> <br /> We also expect our target users to be already
					proficient using data analysis tools, and to want to continue using
					those tools to work with data. Synapse&#146;s first analysis client
					will be an integration with the R / Bioconductor statistical
					package allowing users to track analyses performed with published
					packages or custom scripts to complete their work. Additional
					analysis platforms (e.g. Gene Pattern or Matlab) will get supported
					over time. All analysis platforms would interact with the Synapse
					system by calling the Synapse web service layer. This is a set of
					REST-based services providing support for annotating, querying, and
					updating data, analysis code, and models, and controlling access to
					these resources. These services will also allow tracking of the
					provenance of a multi-step analysis procedure, and executing
					analysis steps on cloud-based resources.
