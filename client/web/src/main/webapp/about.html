				<h2>About Synapse</h2>
				<div class="info">

					The past two decades have seen an amazing exponential growth in the
					technical ability to generate genetic and biomolecular data fueled
					by incredible advances in measurement technologies. These
					breakthroughs have resulted in an increasing amount of resources
					directed at genomic research by both industry and academia.
					However, with a few exceptions, these investments have failed to
					improve prevention or treatment of common human disease. For
					example, the numbers of new drugs approved by the FDA has actually
					declined over this period.<br />
					<br /> A fundamental reason for this discrepancy between data
					generation and clinical improvement is the immature development of

					analytical techniques to meaningfully interpret these new data
					types. As with any new field, analytical methodologies need to be
					iteratively developed and refined. The difficulty of accessing,
					understanding, and reusing data, analysis methods, or models of
					disease across multiple labs with complimentary fields of expertise
					is a major barrier to the effective interpretation of genomic data
					today. Additionally, much of the relevant data to answer a
					particular research question is spread among multiple public and
					private repositories. Because each research group protects their
					own data, the end result is enormous duplication of effort and
					missed opportunities across both industry and academia.<br />
					<br /> Sage Bionetworks&rsquo; mission is to catalyze a cultural
					transition from the traditional single lab, single-company, and

					single-therapy research paradigm to a model founded on broad
					precompetitive collaboration on analysis of large-scale biological

					data. This model would benefit future patients by accelerating
					development of disease treatments, and society as a whole by

					reducing costs of health care and biological research. It could
					even benefit the pharmaceutical industry by seeding increased

					innovation at a time when the sector is struggling to replace
					revenue lost as old medicines go off patent production. Sage

					Bionetworks is actively engaged with academic, industrial,
					government, and philanthropic collaborators in developing this

					research model. <br />
					<br /> The technology component of Sage Bionetworks solution
					strategy is Synapse, an informatics platform for open data-driven

					collaborative research. Synapse will serve as a public resource for
					the broad scientific community.<br />
					<br /> Catalyzing a transformation to collaborative research
					requires a platform that helps scientists solve a series of

					problems:<br />
					<ol>
						<li><b>Finding and using relevant data</b> – Currently, scientists
							have difficulty tracking down and gaining access to data and

							resources generated by others, even within the confines of the
							same organization. Even when data is available, it is often not

							useable. Indeed, an estimated ~75% effort within each analytical
							project is devoted to interpreting data structures and

							appropriately preprocessing data. Synapse provides a mechanism to
							access data in a uniform manner that leverages common formats,
							controlled vocabularies, and annotation standards.</li>
						<li><b>Understanding analysis workflows</b> - Synapse is built with
							the understanding that most analytical research is experimental

							and ad hoc in nature, with hardened analysis methods only
							emerging over time. Tracking who has run what version of code on

							what version of the data immediately helps projects run more
							smoothly, and ultimately enables reproducible workflows that
							allow others to build off of prior work.</li>
						<li><b>Supporting genome-scale analysis</b> - Analyzing datasets
							with information on whole genomes is currently limited to those
							with access to large computational resources and significant IT
							support. Synapse makes cloud computing technologies accessible to

							scientists.</li>
						<li><b>Forming and maintaining productive collaborations</b> –
							Scientists tend to start from scratch on a project rather than
							take work in an unknown state. The platform must help scientists
							track what work has already been done in a particular area and

							help create and sustain collaborations.</li>
					</ol>
					<br /> To ultimately support this vision, multi-disciplinary users
					will need to interact with Synapse. Initially the Synapse system

					will focus on supporting the statistical or computational
					biologists that are directly involved in manipulating clinical and

					genomics data sets; over time support will grow for more biological
					or clinically focused researchers. Synapse leverages a web
					service-based architecture in which a common set of services is
					accessed via different sets of client applications to support a
					growing set of use cases over time. One client application is the
					Synapse web portal: an environment for scientists to discover and
					share data, models, and analysis methods. The portal is organized
					around projects, which any scientist can create and invite
					collaborators to join. These online workspaces then serve as the
					glue to help teams of researchers collaborate to solve complex
					scientific analysis problems. Additional capabilities to visualize
					data and interact with disease models through the web portal will
					be developed over time.<br />
					<br /> We expect our initial target users to already be proficient
					in using data analysis tools and to want to continue using those

					tools to work with data. Synapse’s first analysis client will be an
					integration with the R / Bioconductor statistical package allowing
					users to track analyses performed with published packages or custom
					scripts to complete their work. Additional analysis platforms (e.g.
					Gene Pattern or Matlab) will be supported over time. All analysis
					platforms would interact with the Synapse system by calling the
					Synapse web service layer. This is a set of REST-based services
					providing support for annotating, querying, and updating data,
					analysis code, and models, and controlling access to these
					resources. These services will also allow tracking of the
					provenance of a multi-step analysis procedure, and executing
					analysis steps on cloud-based resources.<br />
