  <h1>goog.ui.AutoComplete</h1>

  Google Buzzwords:<br>
  <input type="text" id="txtInput" style="width:500px"><br>

    This data is being pulled from the server at
    <a href="autocompleteremotedata.js">autocompleteremotedata.js</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ideally the server would perform a search on the query and would only
    return relevant results; however, this response is static.

    var ac = new goog.ui.AutoComplete.Remote('autocompleteremotedata.js',
        input);
