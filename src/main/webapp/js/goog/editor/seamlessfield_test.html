  NOTE: If any changes are made to this file, please keep
  seamlessfield_quirks_test.html synced with this. That file should
  be an exact copy of this one, except for this comment and that the
  <!DOCTYPE> tag should be removed from the top. All tests should be added
  to seamlessfield_test.js so that they will be run by both
  seamlessfield*_test.html files.
